# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è
A Java-based application that provides users with real-time weather information for a specified location. This app fetches weather data from an external API and displays it in a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can enter a location, and the app retrieves and presents details such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.
